## Teacher-Led Project at Dev Academy Aotearoa

### Not sponsored by Hormel Foods Corporation (yet)

---

Welcome to the wonderful world of SPAM! This teacher-led, spam-packed project is designed to help you learn to work collaboratively as a cohort on a single large project. Here you'll consolidate your Bootcamp learnings, write code that prioritizes quality, and become familiar with a more complex codebase.

## About

This project is a playful and engaging web platform designed for SPAM enthusiasts, featuring interactive games, community ratings, and quirky content focused on SPAM. The core MVP offers a fun experience with games, ratings, comments, and a personality quiz, while stretch goals envision deeper customization and user-generated content.

## MVP Features

- **Friendly Home Page:** Welcoming users with a bold image or animation to set a fun atmosphere.
- **About Page:** Educating users about the (fictional, funny) history of SPAM.
- **Games Section:** Users can play entertaining mini-games themed around SPAM, including Spam Jump, Whack A Spam, and Snake.
- **Rating System:** Users can view all SPAM ratings and submit their own, dynamically affecting the site’s average SPAM scores.
- **Commenting:** Community members can read and add comments about different types of SPAM.
- **Personality Quiz:** Users discover which SPAM flavor matches their personality, adding to the fun.

## Stretch Goals

- **Tofu Toggle:** Switch the site to a vegan-friendly experience, where SPAM becomes TOFU in games.
- **Advanced Gaming:** Save scores in Snake and compete on leaderboards.
- **Customization:** Users can enhance their profile with badges and logs (“splog”).
- **Recipe Sharing:** Community members upload SPAM recipes and photos, fostering culinary creativity.
- **Fan Picture Gallery:** Users can upload their own SPAM-related photos to a community gallery.
- **Email Newsletter:** Weekly SPAM-themed updates sent to engaged users.

## Git Workflow

<summary>How to contribute to this project</summary>

- **Main branch is protected—you can't push directly!**
- The name of your branch is equal to the Issue-Number/Ticket-name - for example `git checkout -b issue-8/add-login-button`
- Make changes in your own branch, and commit/push to GitHub.
- Commit frequently with **good quality commit messages**
- To come up with thoughtful commits, consider the following:

1.  Why have I made these changes?
2.  What effect have my changes made?
3.  Why was the change needed?
4.  What are the changes in reference to?

- When your ticket is complete, push changes and raise a pull request.
- After merge, Git Leads will announce; everyone should pull main into their branches.

---

### Branch Protection & CI/CD

The `main` branch has the following protections enabled:

- **Pull requests required** - You cannot push directly to main
- **Status checks must pass** - All tests must pass before merging
- **GitHub Actions CI** - Automated tests run on every push and pull request

Our CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automatically runs tests on:
- Every push to `main` branch
- Every pull request targeting `main` branch

If tests fail, the pull request cannot be merged. This ensures code quality and prevents broken code from reaching main.

---

## Working With Tickets

<summary>How to pick up and work on tickets</summary>

- Check the Project Board (in the Projects tab) for tickets/issues.
- Assign yourself and your pair to the ticket you want.
- Move your ticket to the 'In progress' column while working.
- Move your ticket to the 'For review' column after creating pull request.
- When done and merged, git lead or senior dev will close the issue and move your ticket to 'Done'.

## API Documentation

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

### 🚀 Interactive API Documentation

**Swagger UI** is available at: **[http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)**

Once the server is running (`npm run dev`), visit the Swagger UI to:
- View all available endpoints
- See request/response schemas
- **Test API calls directly in your browser**
- Generate code examples

The OpenAPI specification is available in `openapi.yaml` at the root of the project.

### Accessing Authenticated Routes

<details>

#### Getting an access token

Suppose you want to generate an access token for a user (e.g. our example user `fakeuser@example.org`) so that you can test your server-side routes.

- Open Postman and fill in the following information:

- URL: **POST** `https://dev-academy-spam.au.auth0.com/oauth/token`
- **_For POSTMAN:_** Change the body to `x-www-form-urlencoded` and fill the following key/value pairs:

| key           | value                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| audience      | https://spam/api                                                 |
| grant_type    | password                                                         |
| client_id     | qzDoSfqNCCOHYee9ULEri6OLnOKO80h3                                 |
| client_secret | ccKbF8P-TlBAHbKIO_ZgpGBF2w6S1SxupVdlMHN0bz0ZQ1TIj-PvH4NLnevQT7lw |
| username      | username for that user (e.g. `fakeuser@example.org`)             |
| password      | and the password for that user (e.g `fakeUser5000!`)             |

**NOTE**: access tokens expire after 24 hours, and you will need to generate a new token by using the same endpoint with the values from above.
It's a good idea to keep the HTTP request in POSTMAN because you'll need it for later.
